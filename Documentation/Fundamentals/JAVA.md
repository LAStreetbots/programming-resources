# Java

## “Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible” (Wikipedia)

Most of our robot code is written in Java. Basic familiarity with Java is essential to contribute effectively. If you know another language, you might skip some basics, but understanding Java is always beneficial. The resources below are optional but helpful.

### Resources

For beginners:

- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) - Online course
- [Head First Java](https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf) - Book

For experienced programmers new to Java:

- [Java for Python Programmers](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/java4python/index.html)

Lambdas and functional programming are key to WPILib's Command-Based system. You can read about them now or after learning more about Command-Based programming.

- [WPILib docs - Functions as Data](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/functions-as-data.html)

The best way to learn programming is by doing. The exercises below are required to learn Java, but keep practicing to improve.

### Exercises

- Write a program to compute and print the first 64 Fibonacci numbers within 1 second. Use [this online compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/) or your own machine.
- Solve 2 easy or 1 medium problem on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) in Java for additional practice.

### Notes

- We use an auto-formatter to maintain clean code. Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` in the terminal within a WPILib project before pushing code to keep the codebase readable.
