# Topic

## One line description, stating what this page is about

More detailed description about what the page is about.
This should also include several sentances about why we use the tool and how.
Detail is good here, since this is our main place to add an intro to the topic.

### Resources

- This should have links to other resources about the topic
- Preferably other people have made these so we don't have to
- Multiple formats are preferred, i.e.
  one video resource, a docs article, and an online course

### Examples

- This should link to example code for this topic, if applicable
- Previous season code is fine
  - This can also have notes about what is/isn't good about these examples, or to explain what practices differ between our current code and the example
  - These notes can be longer than the linked descriptions

### Exercises

- Have some practice exercises for this topic
- This should be enough for a student to prove they understand the topic, and is the requirement to get checked off for the course

### Notes

- These are any extraneous notes on good practice or team specific things

### Whats Next?

- Next course in course progression, if applicable
