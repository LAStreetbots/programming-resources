# CTRE Phoenix Library API

## One line description, stating what this page is about

An overview of the CTRE Phoenix Library API and its integration with the WPILib for FRC robotics.

The CTRE Phoenix Library API provides a comprehensive set of tools for controlling and configuring various motor controllers and sensors used in FRC robotics. This library is essential for teams using CTRE hardware, such as the TalonFX motor controllers, CANcoders, and Pigeon IMUs. The Phoenix API allows for advanced control features, including closed-loop control, motion profiling, and simulation support, all while integrating seamlessly with the WPILib framework. This integration ensures that teams can leverage the powerful features of both libraries to create robust and efficient robot control systems.

### Examples

- [CTRE Phoenix Quickstart Example](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/examples/quickstart.html)
  - This example demonstrates the basic setup and control of a four-motor drivetrain using TalonFX motor controllers.
  - Notes: The example uses open-loop control and provides a good starting point for understanding motor controller configuration and control requests.

- [WPILib Integration Example](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/wpilib-integration/motorcontroller-integration.html)
  - This example shows how to integrate CTRE motor controllers with WPILib's DifferentialDrive class for arcade drive control.
  - Notes: Highlights the use of the MotorController interface, which allows for seamless integration with WPILib's drivetrain classes.

- [Swerve Drive Example](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/mechanisms/swerve/swerve-overview.html)
  - This example covers the setup and control of a swerve drivetrain using the CTRE Phoenix API.
  - Notes: Focuses on the use of SwerveModuleConstants and SwerveDrivetrain classes to simplify swerve module configuration and control.

### Exercises

1. **Basic Motor Control**
   - Configure a TalonFX motor controller to run in open-loop mode.
   - Write code to control the motor speed using a joystick input.
   - Verify that the motor responds correctly to joystick movements.

2. **Closed-Loop Control**
   - Set up a TalonFX motor controller for closed-loop position control.
   - Implement a PID control loop to move the motor to a specified position.
   - Test the control loop by commanding the motor to different positions and observing its behavior.

3. **WPILib Integration**
   - Integrate a TalonFX motor controller with WPILib's DifferentialDrive class.
   - Write code to control a two-motor drivetrain using arcade drive.
   - Test the drivetrain control and ensure smooth operation.

4. **Swerve Drive Configuration**
   - Configure a swerve module using the SwerveModuleConstantsFactory.
   - Implement code to control the swerve module's drive and steer motors.
   - Test the swerve module by commanding it to different positions and observing its movement.

### Notes

- **Thread Safety**: Most of the Phoenix API is thread-safe, but certain objects like `StatusSignal` and `Config` objects are not. Ensure proper handling when accessing these objects from multiple threads.
- **Simulation Support**: The Phoenix API provides extensive simulation support, allowing teams to test their code without physical hardware. Use the `SimState` objects to manage I/O with simulated devices.
- **Signal Logging**: The Phoenix API includes a high-fidelity signal logger that captures all status signals automatically. This is useful for post-match analysis and system identification.
